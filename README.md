If you are an options trader, this algorithm will help you calculate the maxpain region of the underlying asset. Copy OI data from the exchange website and load it into the code and see the magic. The variable 'buffer' will take values that you want to act as a buffer region to protect ypour writing. For eg, buffer = .05 means the output will display athe 5% upper and lowerlimits from the actual maxpain so that you can write your option outside this region.
